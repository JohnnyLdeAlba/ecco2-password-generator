# How Was This Made?

This password generator was built by disassembling the games code and porting it from 68000 assembly to Javascript.

As a little bit of extra spice, the password screen animation used in the generator incorporates a ripple effect that is also an algorithm
ported from the original games!

# Features

- Has an animated password screen like those found in the games.
- A small animation of the Asterite shows users how many globe pairs were collected.
